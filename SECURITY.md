# Security Policy

The following Security Policy of [OctoPrint-Telegram](https://github.com/jacopotediosi/OctoPrint-Telegram/) is based on the Security Policy of [OctoPrint](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/), which can be found [here](https://octoprint.org/security/).

If you think that you have found a security vulnerability in OctoPrint-Telegram (not OctoPrint), please **disclose it to us via a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/jacopotediosi/OctoPrint-Telegram/security/advisories)**.

We are mostly interested in reports by actual OctoPrint-Telegram users that are familiar with the plugin and the OctoPrint context, but **all high quality contributions are welcome**.
Please do your best to describe a **clear and realistic impact** for your report.

For the sake of OctoPrint-Telegramâ€™s user base, please allow us at least **90 days to release a fixed version** before any public disclosure.

## Supported Versions

We only accept reports **against the latest release** of OctoPrint-Telegram, which can be found [here](https://github.com/jacopotediosi/OctoPrint-Telegram/releases).

We do not accept reports against forks of OctoPrint-Telegram.

## Public disclosure and CVE assignment

We **will publish GitHub Security Advisories**.

We **will not request CVEs**, as the scope and distribution of this plugin do not warrant CVE assignment.

## Bounties

Since OctoPrint-Telegram is a free, open-source project, we are **unable to offer monetary bounties** for security vulnerabilities.

However, we are committed to **crediting** security researchers in commits and release notes.
