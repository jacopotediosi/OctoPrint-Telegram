# OctoPrint-Telegram

<img src="extras/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" width="200"/>

This plugin integrates Telegram Messenger with OctoPrint through a bot that can be used in both private chats and groups.

It allows you to remotely control your printer — including browsing and uploading files, starting, pausing, or cancelling prints — as well as viewing snapshots and short videos from your webcams. Send the `/help` command to get a full list of supported commands.

The plugin can also send notifications when specific events occur (e.g., when a print finishes) or at configurable intervals during a print.
