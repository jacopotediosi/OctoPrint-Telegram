# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 18 August 2025

## Purpose

This document explains how data is processed when using [**OctoPrint-Telegram**](https://github.com/jacopotediosi/OctoPrint-Telegram), a plugin for [OctoPrint](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint), an open-source 3D printer management software.

This policy represents a **best-effort attempt to transparently inform users** and **does not constitute legal advice**.

This policy applies specifically to the OctoPrint-Telegram plugin and not to OctoPrint itself or other plugins.

## Data Collection and Use

### OctoPrint Tracking

OctoPrint itself (not OctoPrint-Telegram) may collect **anonymous usage data** through its **opt-in tracking**. This tracking occurs only if the user has explicitly enabled it.

- For more details, see [**OctoPrint Tracking**](https://tracking.octoprint.org/).

### Data Handling by the Plugin Maintainers

Since OctoPrint-Telegram does not include any tracking/telemetry system, **the plugin does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or usage data to the maintainers**.

The plugin operates on the user’s own OctoPrint instance. The **maintainers have no access to the user’s system, data, or communications**.

### Data Routed Through Telegram

OctoPrint-Telegram is designed specifically to connect OctoPrint with [**Telegram**](https://telegram.org/), enabling users to send commands to their OctoPrint instance and receive notification messages through Telegram.

Commands and notification messages contain only information related to OctoPrint and the connected printers and devices, such as printer and device names, printing status details, and data from files stored in OctoPrint (e.g., file names and file contents).
Notification messages could also include photos and videos from webcams connected to OctoPrint, if the user configures them accordingly.

- Commands sent to the bot and notification messages generated by the plugin pass through **Telegram’s cloud**.
- Handling of this data is governed by [**Telegram’s Privacy Policy**](https://telegram.org/privacy/).

### Optional Third-Party Cloud Services

Certain features of OctoPrint-Telegram rely on external cloud services, which are **strictly opt-in**.
Activation requires explicit and deliberate user consent (e.g., checking a box in the settings or entering a personal API token) and is entirely managed by the user within their own OctoPrint instance.
The plugin maintainers have no involvement in and no visibility into this process.

Currently supported optional cloud services:

- **IMGBB** (for gcode thumbnail uploads), subject to [IMGBB Privacy Policy](https://imgbb.com/privacy).

### Integration with Other Plugins

OctoPrint-Telegram may integrate with additional OctoPrint plugins.

Integration means that OctoPrint-Telegram can access data from these plugins and include it in Telegram notification messages, such as additional details about files and prints.
In some cases, it also allows control of plugin functionalities through Telegram commands, for example turning smart plugs on and off.

Installation of these plugins is **strictly manual** and must be performed through the installation mechanisms offered by OctoPrint.

- Users must consult the respective plugin’s privacy policy prior to use.
- A non-exhaustive list of supported plugins is available on the [OctoPrint-Telegram Wiki](https://github.com/jacopotediosi/OctoPrint-Telegram/wiki/01-%E2%80%90-Installation#additional-requirements).

## Summary

- **No data is collected by OctoPrint-Telegram maintainers.**
- **Telegram messages and commands are processed by Telegram, under [Telegram’s Privacy Policy](https://telegram.org/privacy/).**
- **Optional third-party cloud services require explicit consent and are governed by their own policies.**
- **Third-party plugin integrations occur only with plugins explicitly installed by the user and are governed by the respective plugin’s privacy policy.**
